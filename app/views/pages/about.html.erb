<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
      Welcome to X-change U! X-change U is an online application that you can use to connect to peers at your university with the same classes, clubs, interests, and extracurricular activities as you. Arrange study groups, review sessions, meetings, events, and more through our comprehensive database and find other students with common and complimentary interests and skills. With X-change U, you broaden and improve your experience at school by getting matched to other students just like you who want to engage in constructive, collaborative activities to get help, get connected, and get involved in the X-change! Meet someone to start a new volunteer outreach project you’ve been brainstorming all semester but never got around to, or find someone who’s working in Chicago next summer in an internship, or even organize a final review session for your computer science class. Start your search today by entering a few of your favorite classes, things to do, and places to see. You’ll be surprised what you can accomplish on the X-change!
